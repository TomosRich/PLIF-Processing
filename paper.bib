A fluorescent dye is used as a scalar proxy, and local fluorescence caused by excitation from a thin laser sheet can be related to dye concentration.

@article{Baj2016,
   abstract = {A new technique of planar laser-induced fluorescence calibration is presented in this work. It accounts for a nonlinear dye response at high concentrations, an illumination light attenuation and a secondary fluorescence’s influence in particular. An analytical approximation of a generic solution of the Beer–Lambert law is provided and utilized for effective concentration evaluation. These features make the technique particularly well suited for high concentration measurements, or those with a large range of concentration values, c, present (i.e. a high dynamic range of c). The method is applied to data gathered in a water flume experiment where a stream of a fluorescent dye (rhodamine 6G) was released into a grid-generated turbulent flow. Based on these results, it is shown that the illumination attenuation and the secondary fluorescence introduce a significant error into the data quantification (up to 15 and 80 %, respectively, for the case considered in this work) unless properly accounted for.},

@article{Vanderwel2014,
   abstract = {The purpose of this article was to assess the measurement uncertainty of the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) method and, as much as possible, to devise corrections for predictable biases. More specifically, we considered the measurement of concentration maps in cross sections parallel to and normal to the axis of a slender plume containing Rhodamine 6G as a passive scalar tracer and transported by a turbulent shear flow. In addition to previously examined sources of error related to PLIF, we also investigated several unexplored ones. First, we demonstrated that errors would arise if the laser sheet thickness was comparable to or larger than the thickness of the instantaneous plume. We then investigated the effect of secondary fluorescence, which was attributed to absorption and re-emission of primary fluorescence by dye both within and outside the laser sheet. We found that, if uncorrected, this effect would contaminate the calibration as well as the instantaneous concentration measurements of the plume, and proposed methods for the correction of these errors and for identifying the instantaneous boundaries of the in-sheet dye regions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Greening cities is a key solution to improve the urban microclimate and mitigate the impact of climate change. However, the effect of tree planting on pollutant dispersion in streets is still a debated topic. To shed light on this issue, we present a wind-tunnel experiment aimed at investigating the effect of trees on street canyon ventilation. An idealized urban district was simulated by an array of blocks, and two rows of model trees were arranged at the sides of a street canyon oriented perpendicularly with respect to the wind direction. Reduced scale trees were chosen to mimic a realistic shape and aerodynamic behaviour. Three different spacings between the trees were considered. A passive scalar was injected from a line source placed at ground level and concentration measurements were performed in the whole canyon. Results show that the presence of trees alters the concentration pattern in the street with a progressive shift from a nearly two-dimensional to a three-dimensional field depending on tree density. Despite the significant change of the concentration field induced by trees, the average level of pollution in the street, and thus the overall ventilation efficiency, does not show a specific trend with the density of trees.},

@article{Lim2022,
   abstract = {Pollutant dispersion by a tall-building cluster within a low-rise neighbourhood of Beijing is investigated using both full-scale Large-Eddy Simulation and water flume experiments at 1:2400 model-to-full scale with Particle Image Velocimetry and Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence. The Large-Eddy Simulation and flume results of this realistic test case agree remarkably well despite differences in the inflow conditions and scale. Tall buildings have strong influence on the local flow and the development of the rooftop shear layer which dominates vertical momentum and scalar fluxes. Additional measurements using tall-buildings-only models at both 1:2400 and 1:4800 scales indicates the rooftop shear layer is insensitive to the scale. The relatively thicker incoming boundary layer affects the Reynolds stresses, the relative size of the pollutant source affects the concentration statistics and the relative laser-sheet thickness affects the spatially averaged results of the measured flow field. Low-rise buildings around the tall building cluster cause minor but non-negligible offsets in the peak magnitude and vertical location, and have a similar influence on the velocity and concentration statistics as the scale choice. These observations are generally applicable to pollutant dispersion of realistic tall building clusters in cities. The consistency between simulations and water tunnel experiments indicates the suitability of both methodologies.},
